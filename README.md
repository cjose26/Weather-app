# Weather Dashboard

## My task
This task required me to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I needed to use a Third-party API, OpenWeatherMap. The task was completed when a user can search for a city and the current weather and the 5 day forcast is displayed on screen. 

## How it works
Below you will see a screenshot of the weather application when it is first loaded.

The user will input the name of a city into the search bar and click on the search button.

In the example below, the user searched "New York". You will see the current weather and the 5 day forcast displayed for New York. Also, you will note that "New York" has been added to the history section.
